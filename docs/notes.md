+ upload img as bytes, don't save to disk because => conflicts
  + well not bytes, but PIL image object as global variable... a bit ugly I think
- nice HTML pages: 
  - drag & drop or click to upload photo on landing page
  - ditch webcam for now, but think how to implement
- use domain neohuman.one
- use https
- render output as HTML, not matplotlib figure
